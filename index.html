        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          Global plastic production has continued to grow at an unprecedented pace, exceeding hundreds of millions of tonnes annually and showing no signs of slowing as demand rises across packaging, consumer goods, medical supplies, and industrial applications. In 2023, the plastic production in 2023 was approximately 436 million metric tons [1], with only 9% of it being recycled [2].
        </p>
        <image-component tag="figure-1" source="assets/figure1_c1.png"
          subtitle="Figure 1: Graph of Plastic Volume Consumption by Type, 2022"></image-component>
          <p>
            Within this vast volume, we bring our attention to polypropylene (PP), which is one of the most widely used polymers due to its versatility, chemical resistance, and low cost. Despite its prevalence, only around 3% of PP is recycled [3], remaining as one of the least recycled plastics worldwide. Compared to PET or HDPE, which benefit from established collection and recycling streams, PP faces low market demand, sorting challenges, and material degradation issues, resulting in most being incinerated or disposed to landfills.
          </p>
          <p>
            The large-scale disposal of PP plastic through incineration not only fails to maximise the potential for recycling but also contributes to broader environmental concerns. The need to tackle this issue has never been more pressing, as the global community continues to grapple with escalating plastic waste and the imperative to adopt more sustainable practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This broader issue is mirrored within The National University of Singapore (NUS), where a significant portion of plastic waste, especially from laboratories equipment, containers, and other consumables, is composed of PP. Yet, due to the same structural barriers seen globally, nearly all of this PP waste is sent for incineration rather than recycled.
          </p>
          <image-component tag="figure-2" source="assets/figure2_c1.jpg"
            subtitle="Figure 2: NUS Plastic Waste"></image-component>
            <p>
              Currently, the plastic waste, as seen in Figure 2, generated by these labs, including PP plastic, is processed through incineration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our industry partner, NUS Sustainability Strategy Unit (NUS SSU), highlighted that while PP waste on campus can be readily disposed of through incineration, it is nevertheless a missed opportunity. SSU recognised that incineration is an effective end-of-life solution, but sought alternatives that could unlock value, reduce waste, and make better use of this abundant material stream. The real question they posed was: what more can we do with the PP plastic currently being thrown away? 
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence, we were presented with our initial problem statement:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
              "What can we do with the current polypropylene (PP) waste in NUS?"
            </p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div id="section-header-2">
        <h2>2. Project Scope</h2>
      </div>

      <div id="understanding-the-problem">
        <h3>2.1 Understanding the Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Building on SSU’s challenge of exploring what more can be done with polypropylene waste on campus, our first step was to understand the scale of PP being discarded, particularly from laboratories across NUS. PP is widely used in lab settings due to its chemical resistance and suitability for sterile consumables, meaning it appears in large volumes across routine scientific work.
        </p>
        <p>
          To estimate the magnitude of this waste stream, NUS SSU provided preliminary figures indicating that an average laboratory disposes of roughly <strong>20 pipette tip boxes per week</strong>. Assuming approximately <strong>300 laboratories</strong> across the university and a weight of <strong>107 grams per PP pipette box</strong>, the total amount of PP discarded reaches an estimated <strong>33,384 kilograms per year</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This represents a substantial volume of material that is currently being incinerated despite its recyclability and potential value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognising this, our project began by examining pathways to repurpose or recycle PP waste within campus workflows. By identifying viable methods to reuse PP locally, we could not only reduce waste but also align with the campus’ broader sustainability goals on campus [4].
        </p>

        <div id="evaluating-pp-recycling-rate">
          <h4>2.1.1 Evaluating Polypropylene's Recycling Rate</h4>
          <p>
            We first broke down the project by evaluating the key factors behind PP’s low recycling rate. The following table highlights the key issues surrounding PP recycling.
          </p>
          <custom-table-component tag="table-1" source="assets/table1_c2.jpg"
            subtitle="Table 1: Key Issues Surrounding PP Recycling"></custom-table-component>
            <p>
              As a result, global recycling systems prioritize PET and HDPE due to established bottle-return markets; PP lacks widespread processing lines and infrastructure, hence leaving it highly unrecycled [9].
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="core-challenge">
          <h4>2.1.2 Core Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            The core challenge with PP recycling is creating value for rPP as a resource - there is simply little economic incentive to recycle PP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of focusing solely on improving the recycling process, the goal should be to develop end-use applications and markets for rPP that recognise its value, thereby driving demand and making it a viable, sustainable material.
          </p>
          <p>
            By creating value for rPP, we can incentivise more effective recycling, transforming PP waste into a resource that contributes to a circular economy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="viable-methods-pp-waste">
          <h4>2.1.3 Viable Methods for Handling PP Waste</h4>
          <p>
            To effectively address PP waste, our team explored and compared three viable methods for upcycling and reusing this material: sequestration, repurposing, and recycling. These methods were evaluated based on their potential for further reuse, which creates new value for the material.
          </p>
          <custom-table-component tag="table-2" source="assets/table2_c2.jpg"
            subtitle="Table 2: Possible Methods of Upcycling and Reusing PP"></custom-table-component>
          <p>
            Based on this comparison, <strong>recycling</strong> emerges as the most sustainable and value-generating approach for managing PP waste. Not only does it allow for the creation of new products, but it also promotes the circulation of materials, thereby contributing to a more sustainable, closed-loop system. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, focusing efforts on improving the infrastructure and processes for recycling PP is crucial for enhancing its reusability and maximising its potential as a valuable resource.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="evaluation-potential-methods">
          <h4>2.1.4 Evaluation of Potential Methods for PP Recycling</h4>
          <p>
            To further explore the possibilities for recycling PP waste, we narrowed it down to three potential directions for reusing this material within the recycling process: <strong>plastic sheets, pellets</strong>, and <strong>3D printing filament</strong>.
          </p>
          <custom-table-component tag="table-3" source="assets/table3_c2.jpg"
            subtitle="Table 3: Potential Directions for Reusing PP"></custom-table-component>
          <p>
            We determined our next steps by assessing each recycling pathway through two key factors: <strong>infrastructure cost</strong> and <strong>value-add</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Infrastructure costs reflect the level of equipment, technical requirements, and operational setup needed to carry out each method, which directly influence how feasible it is for NUS to implement at different scales.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Value-add considers how much additional utility or market relevance is created when PP waste is transformed into a new material.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By comparing these two factors, we identified which recycling methods offered the best balance between practicality and the potential to generate meaningful impact.
          </p>
          <custom-table-component tag="table-4" source="assets/table4_c2.jpg"
            subtitle="Table 4: Comparison of Recycling Methods"></custom-table-component>
          <p>
            Based on the comparison in Table 4, 3D printing filament recycling stands out as a promising approach. It offers high value in terms of creative potential for prototyping and small-scale manufacturing. 
          </p>
          <p>
            While plastic sheets and pelletizing each have their merits, they either lack the versatility or incur higher infrastructure costs that limit their applicability for smaller, localized recycling efforts. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, 3D printing filament recycling is a suitable solution for both educational and commercial applications. This method offers a high-value solution by directly contributing to creative applications such as prototyping, which has significant potential.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="our-solution">
        <h3>2.2 Our Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Our project aims to convert PP waste into filament. Unlike other recycling methods, filament aligns with rapidly expanding applications in prototyping, education, engineering, and design. This positions filament as the most feasible and impactful product.

            Once the 3D-printed parts reach the end of their use due to design iterations, prototyping cycles, or simple wear, they can be recollected, shredded, and re-extruded into new filament. NUS no longer needs to constantly import filament for students to use in their 3D printing.

            This system is particularly novel: A circular plastic economy is created within NUS, where the material can be recycled multiple times until significant degradation occurs [10][11].

            This localised circularity, turning internal waste directly into internal resources, represents a meaningful shift from traditional recycling approaches.

          Student makerspaces were inherently part of our consideration, as they operate within the same facilities and workflows as engineering and design makerspaces. However, we will not explicitly highlight them, as their activities are already integrated into the broader campus ecosystem of prototyping and fabrication.
        </p>
        <p>
          We interviewed our chosen two user groups to identify their needs, insights, and use cases (Appendix A) when selecting specific filament types for their applications. We detailed the use cases and critical properties for each user group interviewed (Table 5).

          Students from both the engineering and design groups have an extensive need for 3D printing for various use cases, particularly for rapid prototyping, which overlaps across all the groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ease of printing</strong> was identified as a critical property, as poor-quality filament posed a risk of jamming and damaging 3D printer nozzles. Additionally, there is a rising demand for eco-friendly alternatives to virgin filament due to excessive plastic waste from ongoing 3D printing projects - such an occurrence was significant within the architecture group, according to our findings (Appendix A).

        <h3>2.5 Analysis of Current Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          One particular comment from our interviewees was about the lack of reliable printing - notably, a concern about filament jamming caused by inconsistent filament diameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the literature review, jamming is caused by either filament breakage or large deviations in diameter and ovality [12].
        </p>
        <p>
          A filament is deemed consistent if it has
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Minimal ovality throughout its entire length, and</li>
          <li>Low deviation of diameter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This ensures smooth feeding into the extruder during printing. These two key metrics will be explained in greater depth in Chapter 3.1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concurrently, we researched current small-scale filament extruders - 3Devo (state-of-the-art), Filabot, and Felfil (Table 6). While most machines were suitable for producing PLA filament, they could neither produce rPP nor PP filament consistently enough to be used reliably.
        </p>
        <custom-table-component tag="table-6" source="assets/table6_c2.jpg"
            subtitle="Table 6: Comparison of Current Solutions’ Capabilities"></custom-table-component>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that these machines regularly struggle to produce consistent filament. Research mentions that they require uniform input feedstock, thereby necessitating the use of pellets to produce consistent filament. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Only 3Devo, the state-of-the-art, could produce consistent PLA filament using non-uniform feedstock. However, the resultant diameter tolerance suffers more when non-uniform feedstock is used, which poses as a significant trade-off [13].

        <p>
          For NUS SSU who are looking to recycle PP waste on campus, our product is a small scale plastic extrusion machine that can produce consistent, high-quality rPP filament made entirely from campus waste unlike small-scale recycling systems that struggle with extruding PP consistently.

        <h3>2.7 Scope of Work</h3>
        <p>
          To design our small scale plastic extrusion machine, we identified three primary processes of filamentation and studied them sequentially:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Cooling</li>
          <li>Heating</li>
          <li>Feedstock Control</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In the first semester, we focused on cooling, the most critical factor affecting the filament's consistency. The remaining two will be studied in the subsequent semester, after which we will consolidate our learnings and experimental results to design the complete small-scale plastic extrusion machine.

      </div>

      <div id="metrics">
        <h3>3.1 Metrics of Filament Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          Commercial 3D printers are designed to work with filament that is 1.75mm in diameter and circular in cross-section. This geometry ensures smooth feeding into the extruder and predictable flow through the nozzle. Issues arise when the filament deviates from these ideal measurements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Too thick: it may jam the extruder nozzle or increase back-pressure, disrupting the print.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Too thin: it may snap during feeding, or the drive gears may fail to grip it consistently, leading to under-extrusion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As mentioned in Chapter 2.5, there are 2 key metrics that helps us quantify the consistency of filament:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ovality (cross-sectional variation)</li>
          <li>Deviation of Diameter (variation along the filament's length)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These metrics help us determine the quality and reliability of the filament. Although both relate to dimensional inconsistency, they describe different modes of variation and arise from different process causes.
        </p>

        <div id="ovality">
          <h4>3.1.1 Ovality</h4>
          <p>
            <u>Definition</u>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ovality refers to how much a filament's cross section departs from a perfect circle at a single point along its length.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is calculated by measuring the filament's diameter twice at one point, along perpendicular axes, and then finding the difference between the two readings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ovality = Maximum Diameter - Minimum Diameter</strong> <em>(at one cross-section)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Underlying Cause: Anisotropic Shrinkage</u>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ovality is caused by anisotropic shrinkage of the plastic during cooling, which describes the uneven contraction of filament, leading to a slightly elliptical cross-section. This is the result of the <strong>high crystallinity of PP</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, plastics with low crystallinity (Eg. PET and PLA) comprise mostly amorphous regions where molecules are irregularly arranged [14]. These regions will have minimal shrinkage during cooling, resulting in minimal distortion to the filament's shape.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, PP has a semi-crystalline structure with a high degree of crystallinity (30-80%) [15]. Regions with crystalline structures have polymer chains that are more efficiently and tightly packed, tending to have a higher density than in the amorphous regions. As a result, significant shrinkage (1-3%) [16] occurs at the semi-crystalline regions during the cooling of PP from its melted state after extrusion, while less shrinkage occurs at the amorphous regions. This uneven, anisotropic shrinkage distorts the shape of the filament and increases ovality.
          </p>
          <custom-table-component tag="table-7" source="assets/table7_c3.png"
            subtitle="Table 7: Material Properties of PP, PET, and PLA"></custom-table-component>
          <p>
            <em>*rPP/PP material from injection molded products was referenced here as it is the type of waste feedstock raised by NUS SSU</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            From Table 7, compared to PLA—the most common 3D printing material—and PET, which is widely used for recycled filaments, PP exhibits a significantly higher degree of crystallinity and corresponding volumetric shrinkage, by up to eight times and ten times respectively. This makes cooling control far more critical when producing PP filament compared to more dimensionally stable materials like PLA and PET.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Solution</u>
          </p>
          <p>
            The uniformity and rate of cooling affects the degree of formation of the crystalline structures within the material [20]. Ensuring that the filament can cool uniformly, and at an even rate would reduce the amount of uneven shrinkage, leading to a lower ovality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="deviation-diameter">
          <h4>3.1.2 Deviation of Diameter</h4>
          <p>
            <u>Definition</u>
          </p>
          <p>
            Deviation of Diameter refers to the changes in filament diameter along its length, even if each individual cross-section remains circular.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the diameter is plotted along the filament's length, the data points scatter around the nominal 1.75 mm line—some slightly thicker, some slightly thinner.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Underlying Cause: Unstable Extrusion</u>
          </p>
          <p>
            Deviation of diameter is caused by the unstable and inconsistent extrusion of the plastic, which results in portions of the filament to drift above or below the ideal diameter.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is mainly due to PP's complex viscosity being highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations [21]. Even small changes in melt temperature can cause large variations in viscosity, which directly affects the flow rate during extrusion; An increase in temperature leads to a surge in material being extruded, while a decrease in temperature causes significant under-extrusion. These flow instabilities ultimately compromise the tolerance of the filament's nominal diameter.
          </p>
          <custom-table-component tag="table-8" source="assets/table8_c3.jpg"
            subtitle="Table 8: Material Properties of PP, PET, and PLA"></custom-table-component>
          <p>
            From Table 8, it can be seen that PP’s complex viscosity is about 5 and 60 times more sensitive to temperature changes compared to PET and PLA respectively. PP’s extreme sensitivity means that the melting and extrusion mechanism must be carefully designed and tightly controlled to prevent fluctuations in filament diameter.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Solution</u>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ensuring uniformity in the heating of the filament and stability in the extrusion process will minimize any sudden changes in the flow rate, reducing the fluctuations in filament diameter.

        <p>
          The production of rPP filament can be divided into three main subfunctions: <strong>Melting, Cooling and Pulling</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subfunction 1: Melting</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          PP feedstock is delivered into the heating mechanism. The mechanism melts the feedstock to form a continuous molten flow, which is pushed through the extrusion nozzle to form the filament. Temperature is regulated through a temperature control signal, ensuring uniform melting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subfunction 2: Cooling</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The molten filament passes through the Cooling Mechanism, where it solidifies into rPP filament. The Cooling Mechanism should ensure uniform cooling at the desired cooling rate, which is crucial for reducing ovality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subfunction 3: Pulling</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As the filament solidifies, it is drawn by the pulling mechanism and wound onto the spool via the spooling mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two key feedback signals regulate this stage,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diameter control—which monitors and increases or decreases the pulling speed to increase or decrease the filament's diameter respectively</li>
          <br>
          <li>Tension control—which maintains an appropriate winding tension to prevent deformation or breakage during spooling.</li>

A fully integrated system eliminates inconsistencies arising from assembling disparate components, ensuring stable process conditions across trials. This allows us to isolate the effect of our specific modification and attribute any changes in filament characteristics directly to it, rather than to uncontrolled hardware variability.

          We established that the Felfil Evo is able to achieve our technical requirements, and hence our variable configurations are as such:

        <p>
          Once the system reached steady-state operation under these settings, we conducted each experiment by allowing the filament to stabilise before sampling.
        </p>
        <p>
          We defined stabilisation as a period of approximately 2 minutes during which the Felfil spooler's single-axis diameter reading fluctuated by only 0.01–0.03 mm.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows us to confidently attribute any observed differences in filament ovality to changes in the cooling subsystem rather than to upstream process variability.

          <h4>4.4.1 Data Measurement</h4>
          <p>
            Our measurement subsystem, part of the diameter control system, required changes. The Felfil Spooler's built-in single-axis diameter sensor cannot capture asymmetric deformation (ovality), which is common in rPP/PP filament. This is illustrated in Figure 11 and 12 below:

          <p>
            Hence, to accurately quantify the ovality of the extruded rPP/PP filament, we used a vernier caliper to take manual cross-sectional measurements along the major and minor axes instead (Figure 13).

          <ol>
            <li>1.2 metres of produced filament will be collected.</li>
            <li>Each filament segment is measured using a vernier caliper in two orthogonal axes at 10 cm intervals, yielding 20 data points per run.</li>
            <li>The experiment was repeated 3 times under the same conditions.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Multiple measurements were also taken at each data point to ensure the maximum and minimum cross-sectional diameters for accurate ovality evaluation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To improve reliability and account for run-to-run variation, experiments were conducted in triplets to ensure consistency, reliability and reproducibility of results. This allowed us to detect and minimize errors, check for variability in data, and confirm that the observed effects were due to our modification of parameters and not random chance or external noise factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average of these three runs was then treated as the ground truth for that cooling configuration and used as the primary basis for comparison across all experiments.

          <div id="modification-1-description">
            <h4>4.5.1 Description</h4>
            <p>
              Following the baseline experiments using the default Felfil cooling configuration, we proceeded with our first modification to the cooling subsystem (Fig 14), corresponding to Concept A in the morphological chart (Chapter 3.5).
            </p>
            <p>
              To experimentally validate that cooling uniformity is a dominant factor influencing filament ovality, the bladeless fan was selected for its annular airflow profile, which provides low-gradient, uniform circumferential cooling. It is a simple and relatively compact retrofit, making it easy to integrate into our control setup.
            </p>
            <image-component tag="figure-14" source="assets/figure14_c4.jpg"
              subtitle="Figure 14: a) Control setup. b) Bladeless Fan setup, Concept A"></image-component>
            <p>
              The fan was positioned so that its annular outlet enclosed the filament path between the extruder and the spooler (Fig 15), creating a more symmetrical cooling region. 
            </p>

              subtitle="Figure 15: Filament passes through the centre of the bladeless fan"></image-component>
              <p>
                With reference to the methodology in Chapters 4.1.3 and 4.1.4, we evaluated whether this increase in cooling uniformity would reduce anisotropic volumetric shrinkage and, consequently, result in lower ovality values across the 2m filament segment. 
              </p>
          </div>
          <div id="modification-1-results">
            <h4>4.5.2 Results & Discussion</h4>
            <p>
              Figure 16 below shows the mean ovality trends for both the control (default cooling fan array) and the bladeless fan configuration across increasing wind speeds.
            </p>
            <image-component tag="figure-16" source="assets/figure16_c4.jpg"
              subtitle="Figure 16: Mean Ovality vs Wind Speed for Bladeless Fan and Control Setup"></image-component>
              <p>
                For the Control Setup, mean ovality remained relatively low at the lowest fan setting but increased consistently as fan speed increased. This trend indicates that stronger airflow applied from a single direction introduced greater cooling asymmetry, which in turn led to higher anisotropic shrinkage and increased ovality. As wind speed increased from 0.8 m/s to 1.1 m/s, mean ovality rose from 0.062 mm to 0.081 mm. A further increase in wind speed to 1.8 m/s resulted in an additional rise in mean ovality to 0.097 mm, reinforcing the observation that higher unidirectional airflow exacerbates filament cross-section distortion.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast, the Bladeless Fan Setup initially exhibited the opposite behaviour. Between 0.8 m/s and 1.1 m/s, mean ovality decreased from 0.096 mm to 0.090 mm, aligning with our expectation that a more circumferential and evenly distributed cooling profile would reduce anisotropic shrinkage. However, at the highest tested wind speed of 1.8 m/s, mean ovality increased to 0.109 mm. This produced a non-monotonic trend that diverged from our original hypothesis, which anticipated a continuous reduction in ovality with increasing uniform airflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                To understand this, we examined existing airflow studies on bladeless fans. These studies show that bladeless airflow is not truly uniform around the ring; rather, the upper and lateral regions tend to receive disproportionately higher air velocities compared to the lower portions of the annulus. This creates circumferential velocity gradients rather than a perfectly even cooling field (Fig 17). 
              </p>
              <image-component tag="figure-17" source="assets/figure17_c4.jpg"
              subtitle="Figure 17: Circumferential Velocity Gradients [28]"></image-component>
              <p>
                At low to moderate wind speeds, this airflow pattern still improved cooling uniformity compared to the control. However, as wind speed increased, these inherent velocity gradients were amplified, causing certain regions of the filament to cool and crystallise significantly faster than others. This reintroduced localised crystallisation gradients, resulting in increased ovality once airflow velocity exceeded a certain threshold.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div id="conclusion-1">
            <h4>4.5.3 Conclusion 1</h4>
            <p>
              We concluded that while the bladeless fan provided marginally better cooling uniformity than the default setup, it was still insufficient for achieving consistently low ovality across all operating conditions. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Nonetheless, our results demonstrated that a more uniform cooling environment had a positive impact on reducing ovality of the filament. Hence, we progressed to the next modification, a wind tunnel, that further enhances the uniformity of cooling.

          <div id="modification-2-description">
            <h4>4.6.1 Description</h4>
            <p>
              We advanced to the Wind Tunnel cooling system (Concept B) to eliminate the circumferential airflow inconsistencies identified earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wind tunnel confines and channels airflow through a ‘cooling chamber’, ensuring air moves smoothly along the filament’s axis rather than dispersing unevenly. This promotes consistent convective heat transfer across the entire circumference of the filament and reduces the formation of localised crystallisation gradients and hence ovality.
            </p>
            <p>
              We 3D-printed a custom wind tunnel using PLA. Air is supplied by fan motors through four slanted inlet ducts, each oriented to guide airflow along the tunnel interior. This angled-inlet configuration increases the uniformity of the downstream velocity profile and helps maintain steady, axial flow over the entire length of the cooling zone. Figures 18-22 show the 3D-printed wind tunnel, its airflow-velocity simulation, and the assembled setup integrated with the control system.

          <li>
            <b>Unmelted Plastic:</b> There may have been unmelted PP plastic within the heating mechanism 
            that affected the overall rheology and conveyance of the material to the extruder, which we were 
            unable to detect. This could have caused unexpected and significant deviations in filament diameter.

          <li>
            <b>Contamination:</b> The Felfil setup lacked a melt filter, meaning contaminants may have clogged

          <li>
            <b>Cooling Temperature:</b> We did not vary the temperature of the air blown due to complexity

            Although the wind tunnel setup was designed to provide more uniform circumferential cooling,

            <h5>Heating Mechanism</h5>
            <p>
              We intend to design a heating mechanism that applies heat more uniformly along the heating 
              barrel to ensure the PP is fully melted when conveyed to the nozzle. A more even thermal 
              profile will minimise partially melted zones and fluctuations in melt viscosity.

              To achieve this, we plan to experiment with a multiple resistance band heater placed along

                As the pulling mechanism is the last line of correction for the nominal diameter of the 
                filament, it is essential that it actively adjusts the pull speed to avoid over-stretching 
                or under-stretching the filament, which would cause excessive thinning or thickening respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                We intend to design a feedback loop to control the pulling speed by measuring the filament 
                along two axes. This would also improve our ability to track and correct filament ovality.

                Spooling relies on tension to roll the filament into spools, which is standard for producing 
                filament usable in 3D printing. However, excessive tension may cause the filament to bend or 
                buckle around the spool, affecting diameter tolerance.
              </p>
              <p>
                To address this, we aim to utilise a clutch system for the spooler to minimise tension variability.

            <h5>Feeding Mechanism</h5>
            <p>
              From Chapter 2.5, we understand that a uniform feedstock improves the consistency of the 
              filament. However, due to the variability in shape and size that arises from shredded PP waste, 
              we may encounter feedstock-related filament consistency issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, we intend to first design a feed assistor to ensure consistent flow of the feedstock, 
              and second introduce backflow pressure within the heated barrel via melt filters. This would enable 
              a more homogenous flow of melted plastic through the heated barrel while also filtering impurities 
              in the plastic.

        <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
      
        <p>
          In summary, we aim to produce a small-scale filament extruder machine to recycle and valorise 
          NUS’s PP waste into high-value rPP filament. This filament will support engineering and design 
          projects across NUS, establishing a novel Circular Plastic Economy within the university.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          This semester, we focused on experimenting with the machine’s Cooling Subfunction and determined 
          that achieving an even cooling profile is essential for maintaining consistent filament ovality. 
          Through these investigations, we identified a wind tunnel as the most promising mechanism to ensure 
          stable and uniform filament geometry.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Next semester, we will continue experimentation and prototyping across the remaining Subfunctions 
          and Subsystems, working towards the full development of our filament extruder machine.
